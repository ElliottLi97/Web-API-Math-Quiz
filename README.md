# Web-API-Math-Quiz
Here is my quiz created using JS and JS API. It features a set of 5 randommly ordered questions that tests you on your math proficiency. It features a countdown timer that also decreases when you answer a question wrong, a hall of fame to feature the highest scoring player, and a play again button to try and improve your score. 

The site was created using some my own html, css, and javascript code.
